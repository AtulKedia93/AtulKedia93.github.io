									<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_by_per_capita_income">US counties by income</a></h2>
									This is a list of all counties in the US sorted by the per capita income of its residents. This is a fascinating list as you can see how your "neighborhood" fairs economically. In case you thought a certain city's residents seem wealthier or less wealthy, this list might help clarify whether what you saw was the normal of that city, or was it an outlier.
									
									I have so far lived in a county at 50%ile, 90%ile and at 30%ile in this list. The 50 and the 30 counties were rather small cities/towns and I can definitely see overall differences in people's wealth in the two - However - in my experience, the county with 30 is a lot more happening and fun, with a very active and lively downtown in comparison to the other.
									The 90%ile city is a big city, with urban dwellers paying in the multiple thousands for rents, so this is obviously a weathier county, but I wouldn't say they have the "freshest of air" to breath.
									
									The other revealign thing about this is that the country as a whole lies around the 85th percentile mark on this list, see the list around #480. What this basically means is that the number of people above on this list is equal to those below on the list. This shows urbanisation, roughly 480 counties have the same number of people as the remaining 2700, which are also primarily rural.
									
									Further, the last county on this list from the contiguous USA - Oglala Lakota, is part of Pine Ridge reservation. It is unfair that a native american reservation, after having faced centuries of discrimination and undergoing disposesion, should have such widespread poverty. The conditions there have often times been described as derelict.
									
									Other strange occurances are Bronx and Richmond (Staten Island) counties. I've heard people dislike Staten Island and assume it's riddled with poverty. This stat doesn't make it look that way, it's income is larger than both Queens and Kings (Brooklyn). Bronx on the other hand is extremely behind on the list, which shows the wealth disparity (perhaps even gentrification) even within NYC.
									
									This list should have shown, with the x10%ile markers the combined population of the people above or below that %ile. Would have made it very easy to identify where the people and the wealth lives.

									<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Seaboard_Fall_Line">Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line</a></h2>
									
									East of this line is flat (swampy?) land. West of it is hard terrain. So lots of cities exist on this border.
									
									
									<h2>Different places</h2>
									
									I randomly chanced upon the place Las Vegas, New Mexico, (not the Las Vegas in Nevada.) This is located in San Miguel County, New Mexico. This place is so so different from the place I live in currently! The city is a mere 13k and the county 27k. The county density is 2.4 /sqkm! I will not put the details about the county I live in (future I should remember where I was in December 2022 and do the math for comparison), but it is seriously much more populated than the subject county. And my county is located much closer to a large urban city. The city LV,NM receives about 410mm of rainfall in a year - my current location receives more than three times that. The average "Percent possible sunshine" for the nearest large city there, Albuquerque, is 77%, which is quite a bit higher than that at my location. It is actually quite surprising to me that this is below 80% because I had imagined NM to be a lot like NV and AZ-- Dry, sunny, arid. Las Vegas, Nevada in comparison has 86% "Percent possible sunshine" and Phoenix about 87%. I suppose all of these (to be studied and discussed in a future blog, but let me speculate for a moment) are almost equally arid. But since Phoenix and LV, NV receive more sunshine they are more desirable by people and hence are larger cities than ABQ, NM which receives lesser sunshine. Ofcourse there are multitudes of other factors that weigh in much higher than the sunshine hours such as proximity to California, and rivers. But I'd like to think about this aspect in the future. Back to LV, NM and San Miguel County, Most of my colleagues from undergraduate studies, graduate studies, and other connections live in ultra dense places such as Northeastern megalopolis or other large metropolitan areas like LA, SF, Chicago, Texas triangle, or in big cities in India. And all would consider my current county to be tiny and uninspiring. Truth be said, 5 years ago and before I would have thought the same. I hail from a large city(ies) in India and I had been obsessed with large futuristic cities with tall buildings with shining glasses, and bright lights. My choices have changed their course by 180° since then and I am quite happy with it.
									
									I am fascinated by the fact that had my life taken a very slightly different course, I would have been living there in LV, NM right now as I write this letter and not in my current location! I would have been extremely happy with this large, and largely uninhabited place in a mostly ignored state in the contiguous USA. I am happy here where I live and would have been happy there where I don't live. I have often wondered how desolate a place would have to be for it to be "unbearable" to live for me. Keeping within the bounds of the USA, it seems like a rural town in Alaska would be most desolate by most standards, and hence any place in the contiguous USA is not even remotely desolate. Further, if you include the time component of our location, today, on the last day of 2022, the places, cities, towns, villages, counties, states, regions are all progressively more populated than they were 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 years ago and all that with a lot more resources to survive, thrive and stay connected with the world. Hence, this city LV, NM would have sufficed my requirement easily, and it would have been a fascinating new lifestyle there!
									
									Ultimately, you don't need a city to conduct research in astrophysics. You would need groups of collaborators to stay connected with and to conduct research with, but the place does not affect it at all. The place would affect your ability to invite other scientists, or visit other scientists, which would limit your intellectual progress science and so a stronger case can be made to stay close to dense populations, however these are not necessarily an big blockade in the present and will be an even smaller blockade in the future.
									
									<h2>California</h2>
									
									California is a wonderful state. The Sierra Nevada gets blasted with snow during the winter months, while the coasts remain relatively warm. A place called Mammoth Lakes, California has received several feet of snow this season, and since it is in the hills of the Sierra Nevada it feels and looks quite like what one would imagine a log-town in the Rocky mountains like Estes Park or in Banff in Canada. Lots of snowfall and consequently lots of skiing and snowboarding resorts scattered all around. Some of the best views probably present at Lake Tahoe and its neighboring places. Those small towns in the SN are amazing!
									
									Further, the central valley is world renown for its agricultural value. More than half of all fruits, vegetables, and nuts produced in the US comes from California.
									
									
									<h2>US state population historical</h2>
									See a very cool and interactive file that can be used to visualize the trends in US states' populations https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/US_state_historical_population_FRED_SMIL.svg . CA, FL and NV seem to have the steepest rise, whereas ND, SD, IA and a few other seem to have the slowest rise. Additionally, the dip around 1940s along with a corresponding rise in certain states makes sense.
