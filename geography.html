									<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_by_per_capita_income">US counties by income</a></h2>
									This is a list of all counties in the US sorted by the per capita income of its residents. This is a fascinating list as you can see how your "neighborhood" fairs economically. In case you thought a certain city's residents seem wealthier or less wealthy, this list might help clarify whether what you saw was the normal of that city, or was it an outlier.
									
									I have so far lived in a county at 50%ile, 90%ile and at 30%ile in this list. The 50 and the 30 counties were rather small cities/towns and I can definitely see overall differences in people's wealth in the two - However - in my experience, the county with 30 is a lot more happening and fun, with a very active and lively downtown in comparison to the other.
									The 90%ile city is a big city, with urban dwellers paying in the multiple thousands for rents, so this is obviously a weathier county, but I wouldn't say they have the "freshest of air" to breath.
									
									The other revealign thing about this is that the country as a whole lies around the 85th percentile mark on this list, see the list around #480. What this basically means is that the number of people above on this list is equal to those below on the list. This shows urbanisation, roughly 480 counties have the same number of people as the remaining 2700, which are also primarily rural.
									
									Further, the last county on this list from the contiguous USA - Oglala Lakota, is part of Pine Ridge reservation. It is unfair that a native american reservation, after having faced centuries of discrimination and undergoing disposesion, should have such widespread poverty. The conditions there have often times been described as derelict.
									
									Other strange occurances are Bronx and Richmond (Staten Island) counties. I've heard people dislike Staten Island and assume it's riddled with poverty. This stat doesn't make it look that way, it's income is larger than both Queens and Kings (Brooklyn). Bronx on the other hand is extremely behind on the list, which shows the wealth disparity (perhaps even gentrification) even within NYC.
									
									This list should have shown, with the x10%ile markers the combined population of the people above or below that %ile. Would have made it very easy to identify where the people and the wealth lives.

									<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Seaboard_Fall_Line">Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line</a></h2>
									
									East of this line is flat (swampy?) land. West of it is hard terrain. So lots of cities exist on this border.
