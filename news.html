									<h2>Postdoc at NCSU</h2>
									I am excited to announce that I am now a postdoctoral scholar at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. I am working with Prof. McLaughlin on analyzing the nucleosynthesis expected to arise from neutron rich astrophysical environments.
									Go Wolfpack!
									
									<h2>Talk at the 2024 CeNAM Frontiers meeting in South Bend</h2>
									I was invited to talk at the CeNAM Frontiers meeting this year at the Multi-Messenger Astrophysics session.
									<br>
									In my talk discussed recent developments in Kilonova modelling and associated ejecta inference for the event GW170817/AT2017gfo along with the role of equation of state prior and neutron star population prior in inferencing properties of neutron star structure.
									<br>
									This is a fantastic meeting and I enjoyed thoroughly meeting with my colleagues and making new connections with all the scholars! Highly recommended for nuclear astrophysicists.

									<h2>Welcome to O4!</h2>
									On 24th of May, LIGO, in unison with KAGRA, started operations for its fourth observing run, O4. After over two years of upgrades and maintenance work, LIGO is back with an improved detection capability, and will be able to observe neutron star mergers at upto 190 Mpc from us. In the couple of weeks since the start, the LVK has already made a handful of likely astrophysical event observations and alerted the astronomy community via <a href="https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/public/O4/"> GraceDB </a> and <a href="https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars"> GCN </a>. The excitement has just begun, and we look forward to hundreds of confirmed merger. However, for the events that I am most interested in, BNS (binary neutron star mergers) and BH-NS (black hole-neutron star mergers) the estimate is that only a handful of detections will be made. 
									<br>
									With the start of O4, I also had the absolute delight of performing real-time analysis for the binary black hole candidate event <tt>S230601bf</tt> (<a href="https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S230601bf/view/"> GraceDB link </a>) for the LIGO team working on Parameter Estimation as part of a rota group. I served for the week of 28/May to 4/June.
									<br>
									- June 2023
									<br>
									<br>
									<h2>Gave a seminar talk</h2>
									I talked about Multi-Messenger Astrophysics and the detectability of BNS merger properties via gravitational and electromagnetic waves. Talk title: "Multi-messenger Astrophysics: Gravitational waves of quark matter EOSs and ejecta parameter estimation with kilonovamodelling". Link to the pdf : <a href="assets/CCRG_talk_2023.pdf"> CCRG_talk </a> - March 2023.

									<h2>New Paper on kilonovae and GW170817</h2>
									We released a new article on kilonovae surrogate models and parameter estimation comparisons for EM- and GW- based observation.[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.013168"> Link to the open access paper</a>]<br>
									We have developed new surrogate models for light curves resulting from kilonova and perform parameter estimation with them to reveal important agreement/disagreement between GW- and EM- estimates for the neutron star merger (NSM) GW170817/AT2017gfo ejecta material.<br>
									What are surrogate models? These are substitute model for a mathematical function. In this case for estimating light curves from a particular set of NS-merger ejecta parameters. Performing full ratiative transfer simulations takes 1/2 hr on 10x128 cores ~ 20,000 threads, i.e. lots of t or $$$. To avoid the costs these Gaussian Process Regression based surrogates substitute for the complete simulation and can interpolate the LCs rapidly, ~5 mins, on local PCs!<br>
									Why is building surrogates important? Due to the speed benefits mentioned above, But also because NSMs have been known to produce a broad range of ejecta material based on theoretical (more like numerical) estimates. They suggest a range of ejecta masses, velocities, distribution in space, and depend heavily on simulation setup and nuclear physics. This results in uncertainties in the kilonova signal prediction working in the forward direction. I.e. NSM simulation -> ejecta mass, distribution, espansion rate estimation -> kilonova LCs. Our surrogates make that '->' between ejecta and kilonova LCs essentially trivial!<br>
									Vice-versa the uncertainties also makes it challenging to predict the NS parameters starting from the kilonova observation and working backwards. I.e. kilonova LCs observation -> estimating ejecta mass, distribution, expansion rate-> NS parameters. Our surrogates help here as well, hence making rapid parameter inference calculations possible. <br>
									Next, we perform ejecta parameter estimation with these surrogate models to obtain the ejecta component masses and velocities for the event AT2017gfo/GW170817. We find that the EM-predicted ejecta and the GW-predicted ejecta properties do come closer into agreement due to the additional ejecta forms, but still disagree somewhat. The disagreement is especially striking in the masses, while the velocities remain unconstrained either way (Fig. 6).<br>
									We also show the capabilities of our surrogate models that can produce LCs for a range of ejecta component form (shapes [dubbed 'morphology' in the paper]) expansion rate, observation azimuthal direction, and at any broadband filter within a range of wavelengths.<br>
									With LIGO's next observing run starting early next year, it will be exciting to see many more multi-messenger events observed that, via means of studies such as this, will constrain the physics of the formation of the ejecta, and will shed light into the origin of heavy elements.<br>

									<h2>Fun corner</h2>
									The corner of this website where I talk about some of the non-academic stuff that I am interested in.
									<br>
									I am an amateur geography enthusiast, and enjoy reading about quirky, unusual, unpopular places and about demographic trends (urban v rural shifts, state to state migration trends, and so on).
									<br>
									I am also interested in public transit and inter-city travel on trains and buses, and consequently enjoy visiting cities with good public transit network and walkability. During most of my academic and personal trips I attempt to avoid taking a car ride or an airplane as much as possible and have been successful in not having any cars involved only twice so far -- once on a trip to Philadelphia (thanks to SEPTA) and another during a three-week long visit to Northern Italy. The latter took me to 4 cities from Trento, Venice, Varenna, to Trieste, and even then I managed to travel in an environmentally sustainably by means of Trenitalia (including the Frecciarossa) and public buses within the city (or vaporetto in the case of Venice ;) ) all while also being economical and getting a better view country.
									
									<!–– Several scholarly papers discussing the link between health issues with increase in automobile dependence are in the description of this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUzuRL0uJnw) .  -->-->
									
									<br>
									I hope countries gets on the high-speed rail (HSR) bandwagon soon and starts investing more on it and efficient local transit!
									<br>
									<br>
									Some HSR developments across the country:<br>
									1. Keeping an eye out on the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor from Washington, D.C. to Raleigh, N.C. to Atlanta and Jacksonville  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_High_Speed_Rail_Corridor">Wikipedia link</a> since this improves connectivity between Raleigh and the Northeastern cities. <br>
									2. fingers-crossed for California High-speed rail to roll fast!<br>
									3. Brightline West is expected to connect Los Angeles to Las Vegas before LA28 Olympics and will show the benefits of car free travel and environmental gains.
									<br>
									<br>
									Some public transit developments to follow:-<br>
									1. (since this is local to me) Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area's GoTriangle bus network is about to purchase several new electric buses by 2025. (Electric buses have both pros and cons, however as a rider of these buses I'll look at this as a glass half full for now and happily accept the reduced noise levels in exchange for a larger fleet of buses.)<br>
									2. Seattle's 2 Line extension to downtown expected by 2025-26. The 2 Line recently inaugurated in April 2024, but runs only in the Bellevue area. It will be quite transformative once that is connected to the 1 Line. 1 Line also saw a recent extension of a few stations north, which also helps connect more communities.<br>
									3. Caltrain (San Francisco Bay area's commuter rail) electrification efforts are expected to complete in Sept 2024.<br>
									4. Charlotte's CATS is supposed to gain a new Silver line that connects cities to its east with Uptown. This is particularly important due to it being a sunbelt city which typically face excessive resistance towards any transportation development that doesn't involve road/highway broadening.
									
									<br>
									<br>
									I also enjoy playing sports, and at different stages have been fond of playing football/soccer, badminton, squash, racquetball, table tennis/ping pong, billiards/pool, and most recently pickleball.
